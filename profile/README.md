## 💁🏻‍♀️ About Us

The **Women's Association of Innovation for Rural Development** ♀️ (ASOFI) is a collaborative platform for social activism and gender equality in STEM.

Our mission is to **connect**, **empower** and **support female talent in STEM** 💻 for peace building and rural development, mainly in Colombia 🇨🇴. 

A country that has historically faced different faces of violence as a result of armed conflict, intolerance and drug trafficking. **Science and technology are an infinitely powerful but scarce tool to build peace solutions** 🕊️ that bring development to rural areas, prosperity to rural populations and reduce the impact of violence in the most vulnerable communities of the country 👩🏻‍🌾. 

ASOFI promotes female participation, becoming a **point of gender activism and providing the social and technological educational tools** 🎒 (through bootcamps and face-to-face events in girls' schools 👩🏻‍🏫) so that in sisterhood we form the **new generation of women agents of change through STEM**.
